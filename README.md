# Selected Projects

## [dotfiles](https://github.com/bbkane/dotfiles)

Configs for apps I care about - see the [`zsh`](https://github.com/bbkane/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh) config especially :)

## [fling](https://github.com/bbkane/fling)

fling computes and creates/removes the minimal amount of symlinks needed in a directory to refer to files and directories in another directory,  similar to GNU Stow. I use fling to manage my dotfiles.

## [gocolor](https://github.com/bbkane/gocolor)

A tiny cross-platform cross-platform terminal color library that supports enabling and disabling colors.

## [grabbit](https://github.com/bbkane/grabbit)

A small single-binary CLI to grab images from Reddit - I've been  surprised how much I enjoy seeing beautiful wallpapers when I  lock/unlock my computer.
